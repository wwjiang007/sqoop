The +metastore+ tool configures Sqoop to host a shared Hsqldb metadata repository.
This tool basically just starts Hsqldb, while the +job tool+ creates the necessary
tables that will contain the job metadata if they don't exist.

Multiple users and/or remote users can define and execute saved jobs (created
with +sqoop job+) defined in this metastore.

Clients must be configured to connect to the metastore in +sqoop-site.xml+ or
with the +--meta-connect+ argument. Sqoop supports MySql, Hsqldb, PostgreSql, Oracle, DB2,
and SqlServer as the +metastore+ server implementations, but please note that
the +metastore+ tool can only manage the startup and shutdown
of Hsqldb so far.

All services other than Hsqldb and Postgres require the download of the
corresponding JDBC driver and connect string structured in the correct format.

Migration of metastore data from one database service to another is not directly supported, but is possible.
